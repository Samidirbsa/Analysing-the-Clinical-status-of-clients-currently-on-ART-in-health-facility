# Clinical Data Analysis of ART Clients

## Project Overview
This project explores the clinical status of ART clients using de-identified electronic medical records (EMR). The analysis focuses on adherence patterns, nutritional insights, TB screening trends, and viral suppression rates. By leveraging Python and Tableau, we aim to identify actionable insights to optimize ART program outcomes and enhance client care.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Descriptive & Inferential Analysis:** Exploring clinical and demographic variables such as adherence levels, weight, TB screening, and viral load status.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive dashboards and static plots to communicate trends and findings effectively.
- **CRISP-DM Framework:** Structured analytical approach from data preparation to evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `Scipy` for statistical testing.
- **Tableau:** For interactive data dashboards and visual storytelling.

## Key Insights
1. **Adherence and Viral Suppression:** 94% of clients achieved viral suppression with high adherence.
2. **Nutritional Challenges:** 8% of clients were undernourished, requiring targeted interventions.
3. **Gender Disparities:** Slight differences in adherence and clinical outcomes between male and female clients.
4. **Data Quality Gaps:** Missing data in TB screening and nutritional records highlight areas for improvement.
